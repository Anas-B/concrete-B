# concrete Shortint

`concrete-shortint` is a Rust library based on `concrete-core` with the goal
of providing an abstraction layer that provides "short integer" types.

By "short integer", we mean _unsigned_ integers, with usually less than 8 bits
and that fits on a single LWE ciphertext.

The intended target audience for this library is people with cryptography knowledge.
