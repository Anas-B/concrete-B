# Concrete-shortint

## Introduction

`concrete-shortint` is a Rust library based on `concrete-core` with the goal
of providing an abstraction layer that provides "short integer" types meaning _unsigned_ integers with 
currently less than 8 bits and that fits on a single LWE ciphertext.

The intended target audience for this library is people who are somewhat familiar with cryptography.
